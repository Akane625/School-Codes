# Explanation
this was hard to execute into ngrok. The syntax was basic but making it sharable oh my. What I did was in PHPStorm terminal enter "php -S localhost: 8000" or any host at all and went to a browser and entered "`http://localhost:8000/main.php`". After that I entered my ngrok link and added a "/main.php" at the end.
